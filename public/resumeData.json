    "bio":"First and foremost, \"Hello World\". When I printed out my first \"Hello World\", I knew coding would be the start of sleepless nights, nonstop head scratches, and lots of stack overflow, but in the end, something I would love forever. In all seriousness, the idea of implementing software to solve practical problems has really captivated me. For example, I built a Java program that helped me solve my chemistry homework with ease because I built-in a periodic table and some equations that I could use to solve in the click of a button. Programming is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe that programming can be used to make the world a better place.",
